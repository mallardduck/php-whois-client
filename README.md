## A message to Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º people

If you currently live in Russia, please read [this message](./ToRussianPeople.md).

## Purpose

When you need to work with Whois lookups in PHP this library provides a very basic client!

Rather than focus on the user-friendly output this library focuses on the raw Whois protocol. The library is limited in
function since its intended to be a low-level client that handles only request and raw output. Basically the package
supports the look-up of a TLDs primary Whois server and then will do a query of the domain provided.

## Requirements
* PHP >= 8.0

### Past PHP version support
| PHP | Package |
|-----|---------|
| 8.0 | Current |
| 7.4 | 2.0.7   |
| 7.3 | 1.2.1   |


## Features
* Pure PHP based Whois client.
* Simple API for getting raw Whois results in PHP.
* Unicode IDN and punycode support.

## Installation
The best installation method is to simply use composer.

https://packagist.org/packages/mallardduck/whois-client

echo $response;
```
